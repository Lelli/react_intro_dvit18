# React intro workshop DV/IT 2018

This workshop was developed for a React intro-workshop and is inspired by a similar workshop done as part of Facebook's 2017 developer conference, F8.

By the end of the workshop, we will have a simple production-ready weather app.

# Create your first app

To save some time, we'll not set up a local development environment but will instead rely on a hosted one.
Visit [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/) which is an online IDE for web applications.

Here we'll choose React with ES6 and soon you will see that your new app has been loaded in a preview window next to an editor!
